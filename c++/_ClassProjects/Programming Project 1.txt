Conversions:

The program displays a simple menu, gets the selection from the user and then makes the appropriate calculation. Display the following menu:

Display the entered length in:
1.  feet
2.  yards
3.  centimeters
4.  meters

Enter your choice: 

After the user enters their choice of conversion, ask the user to enter the length in inches. Inches should be a whole number (integer). After getting the length use a decision structure to determine which calculation to perform to convert inches to the desired measurement(s). If the user enters a value other than 1, 2, 3 or 4 for the menu display a message that the value is not an option. Do not use a loop.

1. To convert inches to feet the formula is: inches / 12. Use modulus to get the inches left over. Display both feet and inches.

2. To convert inches to yards the formula is: inches / 36. Use modulus to get the feet and inches left over. Display yards, feet and inches. Remember that the value for feet should not include those in yards.

3. To convert inches to centimeters the formula is: inches / .39370. Display 1 digit to the right of the decimal point.

4. To convert inches to meters the formula is: inches / 39.370. Display 1 digit to the right of the decimal point.

Hint: inches to feet and inches to yards must be done using integers (whole numbers). Centimeters and meters will display decimals.
