Display Powers Function:

In this function you will output the powers of all the numbers chosen by the user. It will also have you write two loops to validate input.

    Ask the user to input a number for the lowest or starting value. Validate the the number is not less than 1 or greater than 50.
    Ask the user to input a number for the highest or ending value. The ending value must be greater than the starting value and 100 or less.
    You must use loops for your validation.
    Output the chart as described below.

Your output should be the number, the number squared and then the number cubed. Output a header before you start the loop that labels each column. Use fields to align your numbers.

Here is a sample output should the user enter 10 for the starting number and 15 for the ending number.

        Number        Squared          Cubed
            10            100           1000
            11            121           1331
            12            144           1728
            13            169           2197
            14            196           2744
            15            225           3375            

Note: you will have to fix the decimal point if you don't want 100 cubed to display in scientific notation.
Find Total and Average

This function will use a sentinel loop to total items purchased and then calculate the sales tax on the total.

    The user will input a number.
    If the number is greater than 0, add the number to the total.
    Exit the loop when the user inputs -99. Be sure that you don't add -99 to the total.
    Once out of the loop
        Calculate the tax due on the total
        Calculate the average cost of the items entered and
        and display in fields with the decimal point right aligned:
            the total of the items entered,
            the average of the items purchased,
            the amount of tax due,
            and the total for the transaction.

Use a constant for the tax rate which is 6.25%. Be sure to identify what each value output is. Display the numbers with 2 decimals to the right of the decimal point.
main function

Function main() will call the two functions.
