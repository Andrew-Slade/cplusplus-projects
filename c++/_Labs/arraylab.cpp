	//3.	Declare an array of type integer with 5 elements named iValues 
	//and initialize it with the values 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
	
	//4.	Declare an array of type float with 3 elements named flValues
	//and initialize it with the values 1, 3, 5.
	
	//5.	Write a statement to output the third element of array iValues.
	
	//6.	Write a statement to output the first element of array flValues.
	
	//7.	Write a statement to store the value 12 in the last
	//element of array iValues.
	
	//8.	Write a statement to store the value 7 in the 2nd 
	//element of flValues.
	

	//9.	Declare an integer variable named index. 

	//for the following questions you will use index to subscript
	//the the array not a literal value as you have used before.

	//10.	Assign index the correct literal value to access the third element 
	//of an array. Using variable index as the subscript output the 
	// third value of the iValues.
	

	//11.	Assign index the correct value to access the second element of
	// an array. Using variable index as the subscript, output the second 
	// value of the flValues.
